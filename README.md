# OFFTHELEASH
 Semester 3 project IADE UNIVERSITY
----------------------------------------------------------------
We are building an unreal project that shows people where they can walk their dogs.  Based on existing databases we extract info using APIâ€™s. But instead of just using that data, we are adding a new feature where users can confirm whether these places are good for letting dogs walk off-leash. This makes the platform more interactive, as dog owners can share their experiences and help others find the best spots.
